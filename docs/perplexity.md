# Perplexity evaluation

`ninfer-perplexity` measures the causal perplexity produced by a registered `.ninfer` artifact.
It uses the artifact's tokenizer, Text model, selected Main KV representation, final normalization,
and main output head. It is an offline evaluator, not a serving endpoint or a logits-export API.

## Run the fixed corpus

The repository includes `ninfer-ppl-1m-v1`, a fixed set of 16 independent UTF-8 streams covering
English reference text, English long-form text, Chinese reference text, and NInfer C++/CUDA code.
`full` selects all streams; `--quick` selects one stream from each domain.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --corpus eval/corpora/perplexity-1m/manifest.json \
  --quick \
  --kv-dtype fp8
```

The default evaluation uses a 4,096-token context and a 2,048-token stride. Use `--context` and
`--stride` to change that protocol, or score one UTF-8 file with `--text FILE`. The available Main
KV representations are `bf16`, `int8`, `fp8`, `nvfp4`, and `k8v4`.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --text notes.txt \
  --context 16384 --stride 8192 \
  --kv-dtype int8
```

Run `./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity --help` for the complete command surface. The evaluator loads
the model once, reads and tokenizes every selected stream before scoring, and writes readable
startup, corpus, scoring, and per-stream summaries to stderr. Interactive weight loading and
scoring use one transient progress line; redirected scoring emits persistent progress every ten
seconds. `--log-level debug` exposes internal startup and stream-begin detail. The final
domain/overall table remains product output on stdout; the independent full-precision machine
report is `report.json` under `profiles/perplexity/` unless `--output` supplies an empty directory.

For KV-format comparisons, the recommended long-context profile is the full corpus with
`--context 65536 --stride 32768` and without `--quick`.

## Metric

For a stream `x[0..N)`, every token after `x[0]` is scored exactly once. A window `[b,e)` with target
suffix `[s,e)` contributes:

```text
log p(x[i] | x[b], ..., x[i-1])  for i in [s,e)
```

Each window starts from empty State and Main KV, so history before `b` is deliberately excluded.
The reported metric is therefore fixed-window, truncated-context causal perplexity:

```text
mean_nll = -sum(logprob) / scored_tokens
perplexity = exp(mean_nll)
```

The first window scores `[1,min(context,N))`. Each later window advances by `stride` targets while
retaining up to `context-stride` preceding tokens as local context. Streams never share history.

## Comparing runs

For a numerical comparison, keep the corpus, context, stride, and execution settings fixed except
the variable being measured. Compare KV formats with the same artifact and weight formats with the
same KV format.

The corpus name is a workload scale, not an exact token count. Exact input and scored-token counts
are runtime results from the current artifact tokenizer and are recorded in each report. Reports
contain unrounded NLL/PPL values for every window, stream, domain, and the token-weighted overall
aggregate.

## KL divergence against a lovelace-kld reference

`ninfer-kld` scores the artifact against a base file written by lovelace's `lovelace-kld base`
(sparse top-64 reference distributions over recorded agent turns; format in lovelace
`eval/kld/README.md`) and writes the JSON schema of `lovelace-kld compare`: KL(P_base || Q) over
the base top-k plus a tail bucket, top-1 agreement, and next-token NLL, per window, depth bucket,
and overall. It tokenizes each window as lovelace-kld does (context and reply separately, special
tokens parsed) and aborts unless every window reproduces the base's token hash, scored-span start,
and next-token ids. Q is the causal-scoring output: BF16 logits normalized over the token domain,
which `Engine::score_tokens` hands to an optional `ScoreLogitsSink` tile by tile.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-kld models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --windows windows.jsonl --base base.bin --out result.json --kv-dtype rk4v4-e8
```

`--max-context` defaults to the longest selected window rounded up to 256; `--buckets` selects
depth buckets of the base.
