// Only a cancelled row may commit nothing: its tokens are discarded and its lane is aborted, so
// there is no prefix to fold. Every other row ends a round that really produced tokens, and a

// or a between-round decision cuts a speculative span short. A non-terminal row that dropped
// tokens would leave the sequence and its KV disagreeing about where generation reached.
